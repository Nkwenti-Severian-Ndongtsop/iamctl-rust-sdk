## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please **do not** open a public GitHub issue.

Instead, report it privately using one of the following options:

1. GitHub Security Advisories
   - Go to the repository
   - Click the **Security** tab
   - Click **Report a vulnerability**

2. Email
   - Send details to: security@iamctl.dev

When reporting, please include:

- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Impact assessment (what could an attacker do?)
- Any suggested mitigation

We aim to acknowledge reports within **72 hours**.
